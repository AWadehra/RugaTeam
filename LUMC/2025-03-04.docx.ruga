  "summary": "This document summarizes a departmental meeting from early March 2025. It includes introductions of new employees Tamar (Epi-B PhD on bleeding and thrombocytopenia) and Lynn (internship on fatigue and chronic kidney diseases). Key announcements featured the department's 'Away Day' on 'Scientific Communication' being moved to September. Teaching updates covered the successful AWV1 course and the start of Methoden en Technieken BW-MT1 for first-year biomedical sciences students. Several publications were highlighted, touching on topics like transition to adult healthcare for young people with rare conditions, N-glycosylation in cardiovascular immunometabolism, glycoprotein acetyls response and type 2 diabetes risk, and GLP-1 agonists for cardiovascular outcomes in obesity. The meeting also included discussions on the uses of AI for daily work, with an upcoming presentation on AI for pathway analysis. Important dates, upcoming teaching schedules, and future World Headlines, Capita Selecta, and Research Meetings are also listed.",

  "summary": "This presentation investigates the impact of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment on coagulation parameters in patients with a first venous thromboembolism (VTE), utilizing data from the MEGA study. It explores differences in coagulation associated with GC treatment and the role of coagulation in mediating the risk of recurrent VTE in GC-treated patients. The findings indicate that mean levels of most procoagulant parameters (except Factor X) are higher in GC-treated patients, consistent with observations in endogenous Cushing's syndrome, while global tests like ETP and CLT show no difference. The increased risk of recurrent VTE is found to be partially mediated by these increases in procoagulant factors.",

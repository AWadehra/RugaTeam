  "summary": "This presentation discusses the rationale for and outcomes of pancreatic cancer surveillance, focusing on CDKN2A/p16 mutation carriers. Given the high mortality and low early-stage detection rates of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the general population, surveillance targets high-risk individuals. The study presents 20-year data from a LUMC surveillance program for germline CDKN2A/p16 mutation carriers, demonstrating a high lifetime risk of PDAC (21% at age 70). Surveillance led to earlier detection (33% stage I), increased resectability (83%), and improved 5-year survival (32%) compared to historical general population rates. A comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort from the Netherlands Cancer Registry confirmed that surveillance patients had lower stage disease, higher resectability, and improved lead-time adjusted survival. Future work includes evaluating surgical outcomes, risk stratification, and biomarkers.",

  "summary": "This presentation explores real-world evidence (RWE) derived from routinely collected health data (RWD), defining both terms according to various regulatory bodies. It categorizes diverse sources of RWD, including clinical, mobile health, medication, environmental, claims, patient-reported, molecular profiling, social media, family history, and literature. The document contrasts the uses of RWD across different study designs, from traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to observational studies, and discusses the 'efficacy-effectiveness gap.' Key challenges in real-world observational studies are identified as missing data, measurement error, and confounding. Statistical solutions such as target trial emulation and quantitative bias analysis (QBA), including the E-Value, are presented to address these biases. The presentation concludes that RWE serves as complementary evidence, particularly valuable for regulatory decision-making in post-market safety, post-market effectiveness, and rare orphan diseases, emphasizing the need for robust methodologies.",
